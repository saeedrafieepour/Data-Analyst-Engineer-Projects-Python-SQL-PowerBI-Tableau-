### Executive Summary

Police use of force is a critical issue in Ontario, as it directly impacts public trust and community safety. 
The use of force by police officers must be carefully monitored and regulated to ensure it is applied appropriately, fairly,
and transparently. In Ontario, incidents involving police use of force have raised concerns about accountability, 
racial disparities, and the potential for excessive or unjustified actions. Analyzing data related to police use of 
force is essential for several reasons. First, it allows for the identification of patterns and trends that may indicate 
systemic issues, such as racial bias or the disproportionate use of force in certain communities. Second, data analysis 
can help assess the effectiveness of current policies and training programs, guiding necessary reforms and improvements. 
Lastly, by providing an evidence-based understanding of these incidents, data analysis can foster greater transparency 
and accountability, ultimately building public trust and ensuring that law enforcement practices align with the principles
of justice and human rights.

### Key findings:
•	May to June months involves more incidents requiring further enforcement of the law.<br>
•	Most of the incidents reported were handled by the municipal police (~73%), while the OPP Police department handles only 27% of the cases.<br>
•	The incidents occurred in the areas controlled by OPP reveals that Western and Central regions observe higher incidents.<br>
•	Municipal Police uses Firearm as the major type of force to stop law invaders, while the OPP uses almost equally both Firearm and Intermediate Weapons to stop individuals.<br>
•	The Firearm is used as the most common apprehension of the criminals. However, the officers use less firearms when stopping young and elderly individuals. They use Firearms mostly for people in age ranges between 25 and 34 years old. Similar trends can be seen for intermediate weapons and physical control approaches.<br>
•	The Male individuals involve more incidents than their female counterparts. The Firearm is used as the most common apprehension of both male and female criminals. When using physical control, they use it more often against male than the female ones. <br>
•	White people involve more incidents and the black people stand the second most individuals who commit crimes. The other races show less and Latino people show the least involvement. There are consistent uses of force used among all races.  It seems no discrimination happens on the type (severity) of the force used among the races. <br>
•	Violent incidents such as those involving Weapon, executing warrant(arrest/search), stolen vehicle and property crimes require more severe type of force (mainly firearm). However, family/neighbor disputes, barricaded individuals and safety risks mainly use the intermediate weapons. For person stop, there are equal use of firearm and intermediate weapon. For prisoner control, they use intermediate weapons.<br>
•	When the distance is greater than 7m, the physical control is minimal and the type of force is mainly firearm. The largest physical involvement is for distances less than 3m. <br>
•	As the number of officers increases, the firearm as a type of force used decreases. Similar trend is seen for intermediate weapons and physical control.<br>
•	Both individual and animals, the firearm is the main type of force used. The intermediate weapon shows the same trend. For animals only the firearm and intermediate weapons are the sole ways to enforce law. However, for individuals, firearm, intermediate weapons, physical control, less lethal firearm, and some others, in order, are the type of force used.<br>
•	For physical control, in 37% of cases, grounding is the control mechanism. For the intermediate weapons, over 98% of cases, the CEW is the controlling force.<br>
•	Almost equally, residential buildings and open space combined comprise nearly 79% of the locations that incidents have occurred. There is no specific relationship between the type of location and the type of force used, except that the less lethal firearm is being used mainly in incidents inside residential buildings. <br>
•	It seems the nature of the incident is an influencing factor for the type of force used. <br>
•	When it comes dealing with incidents involving individuals, self-protect, effect arrest, and protecting other officers come first. Next comes, protect public, prevent escape, and prevent offense. For animals, there are other factors (unknown) for using force, and the other main reasons include public and self-protection as well as other officers’ safety. <br>
•	In most of cases, officers want and direct the individuals to comply law enforcement. Next, officers try to deescalate and try to assist individuals to control their behaviors. <br>
•	The officers attempt not to injure themselves or the individual. In 93.67% of the cases, there is no physical injuries for the individuals and 97.62% for officers.
